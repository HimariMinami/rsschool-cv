## About me
I am a software tester with 3 years of experience at "Compit Expert". Conducted load and manual testing.
Open to everything new and interesting. I am a quick learner, hard-working, attentive and non-conflicting. I quickly adapt to everything new.

At the moment, my goal is to take the JavaScript / Frontend development course and become an excellent specialist in this field.

In my free time I like active rest (tents, bicycle, hiking). I love different types of handicrafts (knitting, weaving, embroidery), as well as cooking and trying different foods and drinks. Especially I am very fond of knitting :) I am interested in the beauty sphere. I love to paint pictures by numbers.
